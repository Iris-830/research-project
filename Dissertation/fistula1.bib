	abstract = {Background: Vaginal fistula (VF) is one of the most severe maternal morbidities with the immediate consequence of chronic urinary and/or fecal incontinence. The epidemiological evidence regarding risk factors for VF is dominated by facility-based studies. Our aim is to estimate the effect size of selected risk factors for VF using population-based survey data.
Methods: We pooled all available Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicators Cluster Surveys carried out in sub-Saharan Africa that collected information on VF symptoms. Bayesian matched logistic regression models that accounted for the imperfect sensitivity and specificity of self-reports of VF symptoms were used for effect size estimation.
Results: Up to 27 surveys were pooled, including responses from 332,889 women. Being able to read decreased the odds of VF by 13 \% (95 \% Credible Intervals (CrI): 1 \% to 23 \%), while higher odds of VF symptoms were observed for women of short stature ({\textless}150 cm) (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.31; 95 \% CrI: 1.02-1.68), those that had experienced intimate partner sexual violence (OR = 2.13; 95 \% CrI: 1.60-2.86), those that reported sexual debut before the age of 14 (OR = 1.41; 95 \% CrI: 1.16-1.71), and those that reported a first birth before the age of 14 (OR = 1.39; 95 \% CrI: 1.04-1.82). The effect of post-primary education, female genital mutilation, and having problems obtaining permission to seek health care were not statistically significant.
Conclusions: Increasing literacy, delaying age at first sex/birth, and preventing sexual violence could contribute to the elimination of obstetric fistula. Concomitant improvements in access to quality sexual and reproductive healthcare are, however, required to end fistula in sub-Saharan Africa.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Obstetric fistula is the most common obstetric problem in low- and middleincome countries where maternal care is inaccessible. Obstetric fistula has serious social and economic consequences resulting in devastating health problems for women. There is a lack of national studies that show the burden of obstetric fistula and risk factors; as a result, this study aimed to estimate the prevalence of obstetric fistula, its symptoms, and risk factors in Ethiopia.
Methods: A population-level cross-sectional study was conducted with a total of 7590 women who gave birth in the last 5 years, using data from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey. Complex sample analysis and normalized weighting were used to compensate for the disproportionate sampling in the survey. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to find a significant association between obstetric fistula and covariates. Both odds ratios (crude and adjusted) with their corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were reported.
Results: Among the 7590 women having given birth in the last 5 years, 32 (0.42\%) women with obstetric fistula were identified. Of these, 64\% developed obstetric fistula after live birth and 23.1\% developed obstetric fistula after stillbirth. More than 72.8\% were associated with prolonged and very difficult labor. No history of contraceptive use (AOR = 3.43; 95\% CI: 1.05–11.21), having a big problem of distance from the health facility (AOR = 3.7; 95\% CI: 1.05–11.21), early marriage (AOR = 1.52; 95\% CI: 1.12–3.5), and being a rural resident (AOR = 1.5; 95\% CI:1.2–5.05) were risk factors associated with obstetric fistula.
Conclusion: This study finding revealed that obstetric fistula is the most common devastating obstetric problem in Ethiopia. Early marriage, early initiation of sexual intercourse, distance from the health facility, no history of contraceptive use, and rural residence were the predisposing factors to develop an obstetric fistula. Thus, interventions should focus on creating community awareness regarding early marriage and its consequences, early seeking of health facility visiting, and avoiding unintended pregnancy to minimize the subsequent complications.},

Continuous and uncontrollable leaking of urine or faeces from vagina can lead to life changing stigmatization for women in third world countries. The underlying factors and consequences of this problem are not yet fully identified and adequately documented in Ethiopia.
Methods: This study is based on the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey data (EDHS, 2005). The survey collected information on a total of 14,070 women who were interviewed face to face on their background characteristics as well as reproductive health issues, out of which 3178 women had complete measurements and were considered in this study. Descriptive and binary logistic regressions techniques were used using demographic, socio-economic, health and environmental related variables as explanatory variables and status of obstetric fistula as a response variable.
Results: The results showed that geographical region, place of residence, educational status, age at first birth, age at first marriage, employment status, place of delivery and follow up of antenatal care during pregnancy were significant determinant factors of obstetric fistula in Ethiopia.
Conclusion: The study showed that demographic, socio-economic, environmental and health related variables have an important effect on determinants of obstetric fistula in Ethiopia.},

	abstract = {Childbirth complications continue to remain a major problem in various settings but most rampant in underdeveloped nations, including Gambia, where poor living condition is widespread. Obstetric Fistula (OF) has been cited as one of the most common issues experienced by mothers during labor over the years. The study thus focuses on evaluating the level of awareness of this condition among Gambian women of childbearing age. Women’s Data from the recent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in Gambia was used for the study. A total of 11,864 women of reproductive age, who had completed cases of the variables of interest were used for the analysis. Stata version-16 was used in carrying out the analysis of this study; and Pearson Chi-square test for independence was used to examine the distribution of the awareness of fistula among Gambian women across the explanatory variables. A two model binary logistic regression was fitted to examine the association between the outcome variable and the explanatory variables. The study presented that, majority of the Gambian women (87.2\%) had no knowledge about Obstetric Fistula, as they indicated to have never heard of the condition. Considering the individual factors, age was seen to be a significant factor in determining the awareness level of Obstetric Fistula among women of childbearing age. As they age, the higher their odds of knowing about the condition. Other factors such as level of education, marital status, pregnancy termination, media exposure, community poverty level, and employment were also discovered to be significant factors in determining a woman’s awareness of Obstetric Fistula. Considering the low level of awareness of Obstetric Fistula among Gambian women, there is therefore the need for the appropriate institutions to increase health educational programmes targeted at creating its awareness, and to provide further in-depth understanding of the condition to the few who already have a fair knowledge about it.},

	abstract = {Background Obstetric stula is a leakage between genital tract and urinary tract and/or between genital tract and rectum. The commonest cause of obstetric stula is prolonged labour which magnify in the areas of poor prenatal and emergency obstetric care. In Africa, there is poor of quality of obstetric care and poor social support for those who faced stula. Obstetric stula shatters the life of the women and the consequence is nasty while multicounty level estimate on the magnitude and determinates of stula were nil. Multicounty level of estimate of the magnitude of stula is important to design and ll the gaps of quality of obstetric care and design the appropriate corrective intervention mechanisms of obstetric stula. Therefore, this study aimed the estimate the magnitude of obstetric stula and its determinants among childbearing women in 14 Africa countries based on recent demographic and health survey data.
Methods Secondary data were used from 14 African demographic and health survey database. The data were extracted based on the objective the study and previous literatures. Data were weighted using sampling weight before any statistical analysis to account the sampling design. STATA version 15 was used for extracting, recoding, and for further multilevel analysis. The appropriateness of multilevel analysis were checked by Median odds ratio (MOR), proportional change in Variance (PCV), Intraclass correlation coe cient (ICC), and Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). Four model was build and the best model was selected based on the smallest Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). Both bivariable and multivariable multilevel analysis was done accordingly. Variables with p-value ≤0.05 declared as statistical signi cant with outcome variable for the study. The adjusted odds ratio with 95\% con dence interval was used as measure of association.
Results The magnitude of obstetric stula was 0.84 [95\%CI: 0.79, 0.88]. Maternal age {\textgreater}=41 years [AOR=1.38; 95\% CI:1.01,1.93], urban residence [AOR=0.69; 95\%CI: 0.53,0.89], women who attended secondary education [AOR=0.59; 95\% CI: 0.45,0.77], women who attended higher education [AOR=0.40; 95\% CI: 0.25,0.65], female household head [AOR=0.78; 95\% CI: 0.64,0.95], husbands who attended primary education [AOR=0.80; 95\% CI: 0.65, 0.98], women who give their rst birth 16-20years [AOR=0.78; 95\% CI: 0.66,0.92], 21-25 years [AOR=0.66; 95\% CI: 0.53,0.84], ≥26 years [AOR=0.67; 95\% CI: 0.48, 0.92], history of terminating pregnancy [AOR=1.51; 95\% CI: 1.29, 1.77] and awareness on stula [AOR=0.35; 95\% CI: 0.26,0.45) were the determinants of obstetric stula identi ed in this study.

            Vaginal fistula is a shattering maternal complication characterized by an anomalous opening between the bladder and/or rectum and vagina resulting in continuous leakage of urine or stool. Although prevalent in Ethiopia, its magnitude and distribution is not well studied. We used statistical mapping models using 2005 and 2016 Ethiopia Demographic Health Surveys data combined with a suite of potential risk factors to estimate the burden of vaginal fistula among women of childbearing age. The estimated number of women of childbearing age with lifetime and untreated vaginal fistula in 2016 were 72,533 (95\% CI 38,235–124,103) and 31,961 (95\% CI 11,596–70,309) respectively. These figures show reduction from the 2005 estimates: 98,098 (95\% CI 49,819–170,737) lifetime and 59,114 (95\% CI 26,580–118,158) untreated cases of vaginal fistula. The number of districts having more than 200 untreated cases declined drastically from 54 in 2005 to 6 in 2016. Our results show a significant subnational variation in the burden of vaginal fistula. Overall, between 2005 and 2016 there was substantial reduction in the prevalence of vaginal fistula in Ethiopia. Our results help guide local level tracking, planning, spatial targeting of resources and implementation of interventions against vaginal fistula.},

	abstract = {Background: Obstetric fistula (OF) is a serious consequence of prolonged, obstructed labor in settings where emergency obstetric care is limited, but there are few reliable, population-based estimates of the rate of OF. Stillbirth (SB) is another serious consequence of prolonged, obstructed labor, yet the frequency of SB in women with OF is poorly described. Here, we review these data.
Methods: We searched electronic databases and grey literature for articles on OF in low-resource countries published between January 1, 1995, and November 16, 2014, and selected for inclusion 19 articles with original population-based OF incidence or prevalence data and 44 with reports of frequency of SB associated with OF.
Results: OF estimates came from medium- and low-HDI countries in South Asia and Africa, and varied considerably; incidence estimates ranged from 0 to 4.09 OF cases per 1000 deliveries, while prevalence estimates were judged more prone to bias and ranged from 0 to 81.0 OF cases per 1000 women. Reported frequency of SB associated with OF ranged from 32.3 \% to 100 \%, with estimates from the largest studies around 92 \%. Study methods and quality were inconsistent.
Conclusions: Reliable data on OF and associated SB in low-resource countries are lacking, underscoring the relative invisibility of these issues. Sound numbers are needed to guide policy and funding responses to these neglected conditions of poverty.},

	abstract = {Background: Obstetric fistula among women of reproductive age is a significant public health issue in developing countries, including Sub-Saharan Africa. However, the pooled awareness of obstetric fistula among women of reproductive age in Sub-Saharan Africa and its variation between countries have not yet been studied. Hence, the review aims to assess variability and awareness of obstetric fistula among women of reproductive age in Sub-Saharan African Countries.
Method: Articles were searched using different electronic databases, such as PubMed, Web of science, science direct (Scopus), Google scholar, and HINARI and manual search without regard to publication date. A random-effects model was used to ascertain the pooled prevalence of obstetric fistula awareness among women of reproductive age in Sub-Saharan Africa. Publication bias was checked by using funnel plot and Egger’s test at a 5\% level of significance. I2 test statistics was performed to evaluate heterogeneity among included studies. In addition, to identify the possible reason for the potential heterogeneity between the studies, sub-group and metaregression analyses were conducted. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of individual research on the overall results. The data were extracted by using Microsoft excel and analyzed using statistical software STATA/SE version 17.
Result: A total of 22 studies with 79,693 women of reproductive age were included in this systematic review and meta-analyses. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the pooled prevalence of awareness towards obstetric fistula among women of reproductive age was 40.85\% (95\% CI: 33.48, 48.22\%). Analysis of the subgroups by specific countries revealed significant variation. The highest awareness of obstetric fistula was found among Tanzanian women of reproductive age (61.10\%, 95\% CI: 55.87–66.33\%), whereas the lowest awareness was found in research from the Gambia (12.80\%, 95\% CI: 12.20–13.40\%).The likelihood of obstetric fistula awareness were lower by a factor of 0.424 among studies with sample sizes greater than 3542 (β = 0.424 (95\% CI: 0.767 to 0.081), p -value {\textless}0.05).
Conclusion: According to the current review, there is a low level of awareness about obstetric fistula among women of reproductive age in sub-Saharan Africa, and the results of the sub-group},

	abstract = {Obstetric ﬁstula, characterized by urinary or fecal incontinence via the vagina, has begun to receive attention on the international public health agenda, however less attention has been given to traumatic ﬁstula. Field reports indicate that trauma contributes to the burden of vaginal ﬁstula, especially in regions wrought by civil unrest, however evidence is largely anecdotal or facility-based. This paper speciﬁcally examines the co-occurrence of incontinence and two potential sources of trauma: sexual violence and female genital cutting using the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys in Malawi, Rwanda, Uganda and Ethiopia. Multivariate selection models are used to control for sampling differences by country. Results indicate that sexual violence is a signiﬁcant determinant of incontinence in Rwanda and Malawi, however not in Uganda. Simulations predict that elimination of sexual violence would result in from a 7 to a 40\% reduction of the total burden of incontinence. In contrast, no evidence is found that female genital cutting contributes to incontinence and this ﬁnding is robust for types of cutting and high risk samples. Results point to the importance of reinforcing prevention programs which seek to address prevention of sexual violence and for the integration of services to better serve women experiencing both sexual violence and incontinence.},

	abstract = {Summary Objectives Process evaluation has become the mainstay of safe motherhood evaluation in developing countries, yet the extent to which indicators measuring access to obstetric services at the population level reflect levels of maternal mortality is uncertain. In this study we examine the association between population indicators of access to obstetric care and levels of maternal mortality in urban and rural West Africa. Methods In this ecological study we used data on maternal mortality and access to obstetric services from two population-based studies conducted in 16 sites in eight West African countries: the Maternal Mortality and Obstetric Care in West Africa (MAMOCWA) study in rural Sénégal, Guinea-Bissau and The Gambia and the Morbidité Maternelle en Afrique de l'Ouest (MOMA) study in urban Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, Mauritanie, Niger and Sénégal. Results In rural areas, maternal mortality, excluding early pregnancy deaths, was 601 per 100?000 live births, compared with 241 per 100?000 for urban areas [RR?=?2.49 (CI 1.77?3.59)]. In urban areas, the vast majority of births took place in a health facility (83\%) or with a skilled provider (69\%), while 80\% of the rural women gave birth at home without any skilled care. There was a relatively close link between levels of maternal mortality and the percentage of births with a skilled attendant (r?=??0.65), in hospital (r?=??0.54) or with a Caesarean section (r?=??0.59), with marked clustering in urban and rural areas. Within urban or rural areas, none of the process indicators were associated with maternal mortality. Conclusion Despite the limitations of this ecological study, there can be little doubt that the huge rural?urban differences in maternal mortality are due, at least in part, to differential access to high quality maternity care. Whether any of the indicators examined here will by themselves be good enough as a proxy for maternal mortality is doubtful however, as more than half of the variation in mortality remained unexplained by any one of them.},

	abstract = {The consequences of living with obstetric fistula are multifaceted and very devastating for women, especially those living in poor resource settings. Due to uncontrollable leakages of urine and/or feces, the condition leaves women with peeling of skin on their private parts, and the wetness and smell subject them to stigmatization, ridicule, shame and social isolation. We sought to gain a deeper understanding of lived experiences of women with obstetric fistula in Malawi, in order to recommend interventions that would both prevent new cases of obstetric fistula as well as improve the quality of life for those already affected. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 25 women with obstetric fistula at Bwaila Fistula Care Center in Lilongwe and in its surrounding districts. We interviewed twenty women at Bwaila Fistula Care Center; five additional women were identified through snowball sampling and were interviewed in their homes. We also interviewed twenty family members. To analyze the data, we used thematic analysis. Data were categorized using Nvivo 10. Goffman’s theory of stigma was used to inform the data analysis. All the women in this study were living a socially restricted and disrupted life due to a fear of involuntary disclosure and embarrassment. Therefore, “anticipated” as opposed to “enacted” stigma was especially prevalent among the participants. Many lost their positive self-image due to incontinence and smell. As a way to avoid shame and embarrassment, these women avoided public gatherings; such as markets, church, funerals and weddings, thus losing part of their social identity. Participants had limited knowledge about their condition. The anticipation of stigma by women in this study consequently limited their social lives. This fear of stigma might have arisen from previous knowledge of social norms concerning bowel and bladder control, which do not take into account an illness like obstetric fistula. This misconception might have also arisen from lack of knowledge about causes of the condition itself. There is need therefore to create awareness and educate women and their communities about the causes of obstetric fistula, its prevention and treatment, which may help to prevent fistula as well as reduce all dimensions of stigma, and consequently increase dignity and quality of life for these women.},

	abstract = {Abstract Obstetric fistula can be explained to result from different causes. These holes in the tissue wall between the vagina and bladder and/or rectum are most prevalent in resource-poor countries, attributable to prolonged obstructed labour and absent or inaccessible remedial prenatal services. Obstructed labour is often due to small pelvic size, resulting from women's youth and premature childbearing and/or malnutrition. Poverty at national health-service and family levels often predisposes pregnant populations to suffer high rates of fistula. Global estimates showing up to 100,000 new cases each year and 2 million affected girls and women are probably gross underestimates. Fistula devastates lives of sufferers, who are often expelled by husbands and become isolated from their families and communities. Failures of states to provide prenatal preventive care (including medically indicated cesarean deliveries) and timely fistula repair violate women's internationally recognized human rights, especially to healthcare in general and reproductive healthcare in particular.},

The objective of this systematic review was to synthesize the evidence from published articles on the consequences of obstetric fistula on women who endure the condition. The consequences were systematically reviewed from purely qualitative and mixed method primary studies. The literatures were searched through the search engines Google, Google scholar, Hinari using Pub Med data bases, and citation tracking. Relevant source of publications were searched for primary qualitative studies by formulating search protocol using related search terms. Time (articles published between January first of 2007 and 30th September 2016), participants (women who experienced obstetric fistula due to obstructed labor complications), types of study (purely qualitative and mixed method primary articles), findings (reporting consequences/impacts of obstetric fistula) were used as inclusion criteria. The quality appraisal tool for qualitative studies and the critical appraisal skills program were used to appraise the quality of the studies. The findings of sixteen studies were included in the review. The data were collected and then a thematic framework approach was applied for analysis. The thematic categories shared across most studies were related to the physical challenges of losing body control, women’s social and family relationships, and the challenges of losing income. Obstetric fistula has far reaching consequences on women’s physical well being, social and marital relationships, mental health and economic capacity. Fistula also challenged women coping abilities. The consequences of obstetric fistula are far more than the visible medical condition. Little evidence is available on mental health, child and fertility issues, and coping mechanisms. Therefore, further researches shall be aimed at addressing the understudied area and suitable interventions shall be offered to improve women’s overall quality of life.},

Better knowledge of the risk factors for obstetric fistula could help in preventing its occurrence. The purpose of this study was to assess the characteristics of obstetric fistula patients. We conducted a search of the literature to identify all relevant articles published during the period from 1987–2008. Among the 19 selected studies, 15 were reports from sub-Saharan Africa and 4 from the Middle East. Among the reported fistula cases, 79.4\% to 100\% were obstetrical while the remaining cases were from other causes. Rectovaginal fistulae accounted for 1\% to 8\%, vesicovaginal fistulae for 79\% to 100\% of cases, and combined vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistulae were reported in 1\% to 23\% of cases. Teenagers accounted for 8.9\% to 86\% of the obstetrical fistulae patients at the time of treatment. Thirty-one to 67\% of these women were primiparas. Among the obstetric fistula patients, 57.6\% to 94.8\% of women labor at home and are secondarily transferred to health facilities. Nine to 84\% percent of these women delivered at home. Many of the fistula patients were shorter than 150 cm tall (40–79.4\%). The mean duration of labor among the fistula patients ranged from 2.5 to 4 days. Twenty to 95.7\% of patients labored for more than 24 h. Operative delivery was eventually performed in 11\% to 60\% of cases. Obstetric fistula was associated with several risk factors, and they appear to be preventable. This knowledge should be used in strengthening the preventive strategy both at the health facility and at the community level.},

Design Qualitative phenomenological study using a series of in-depth semi-structured interviews at two time points: prior to fistula repair and 6 months post-surgery. Data were analysed thematically. Setting Three fistula clinics in three districts in Kenya. Population A purposive sample of 16 women suffering with vaginal fistula who were seeking fistula repair. Methods Thrity-two semi-structured interviews were conducted. Results The two main themes represented the women's journeys from social isolation to social reintegration. Women felt euphoric following fistula repair, believing that a ?miracle? had occurred. However, the ?post-miracle phase? demonstrated that the social and psychological impact of fistula leaves scars that are not easily healed, even when fistula repair is successful. Conclusion Women's experiences of living with fistula have an impact beyond that which can be repaired solely by surgery. The findings from this study support the need for more active psychological assessment in the management of women with fistula, and the role of targeted psychological support in any package of care given in the post repair phase. The format of this support requires further study. Engagement by health professionals with the wider community could raise awareness of the causes of fistula, and provide support for significant others who may also be feeling vulnerable. It is likely that the collaborative efforts from health professionals and community members will provide the most effective support.

	abstract = {In the United States, awareness is increasing that medical care alone cannot adequately improve health overall or reduce health disparities without also addressing where and how people live. A critical mass of relevant knowledge has accumulated, documenting associations, exploring pathways and biological mechanisms, and providing a previously unavailable scientific foundation for appreciating the role of social factors in health. We review current knowledge about health effects of social (including economic) factors, knowledge gaps, and research priorities, focusing on upstream social determinants—including economic resources, education, and racial discrimination—that fundamentally shape the downstream determinants, such as behaviors, targeted by most interventions. Research priorities include measuring social factors better, monitoring social factors and health relative to policies, examining health effects of social factors across lifetimes and generations, incrementally elucidating pathways through knowledge linkage, testing multidimensional interventions, and addressing political will as a key barrier to translating knowledge into action.},

However, inequities, both between and within countries, persist. The review reported here, of inequities in health between and within countries across the 53 Member States of the WHO European region, was commissioned to support the development of the new health policy framework for Europe: Health 2020. Much more is understood now about the extent, and social causes, of these inequities, particularly since the publication in 2008 of the report of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health. The European review builds on the global evidence and recommends policies to ensure that progress can be made in reducing health inequities and the health divide across all countries, including those with low incomes. Action is needed—on the social determinants of health, across the life course, and in wider social and economic spheres—to achieve greater health equity and protect future generations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}h2{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h2{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Improving female empowerment is an important human rights and development goal that needs better monitoring. A number of indices have been developed to track female empowerment at the national level, but these are incomplete and may obscure important sub-national variation. We developed the Female Empowerment Index (FEMI) to track multiple domains of women's empowerment at the sub-national level. The index is based on six categories of empowerment: violence against women, employment, education, reproductive healthcare, decision making, and access to contraceptives. The FEMI has a range of zero to one (low to high empowerment), and it is calculated as the mean proportion of positive outcomes in the six categories. To provide a proof of concept, we computed the FEMI for Nigeria and its 36 states from five Demographic and Health Surveys between the years of 1990 and 2013, using questions asked to 98,542 women between 15 and 49 years old. At the national level, the FEMI increased from 0.34 to 0.48. However, there was substantial sub-national variation, with state-level values ranging from 0.16-0.60 in 1990 to 0.19–0.73 in 2013. Our findings thus illustrate the importance of considering sub-national variation in female empowerment. The FEMI can be readily computed for other countries, and its ability to track spatial and temporal variation in woman's empowerment across a broad set of categories may make it more useful than existing approaches.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Information was obtained on Pubmed (medline), WHO website, Bioline Innternational, African Journal on Line, Google scholar, Yahoo, Medscape and e Medicine.RESULTS: Many Nigerian women are living with vesicovaginal fistula. The annual obstetric fistula incidence is estimated at 2.11 per 1000 births. It is more prevalent in northern Nigeria than southern Nigeria. Obstetric fistula accounts for 84.1\%–100\% of the vesicovaginal fistula and prolonged obstructed labour is consistently the most common cause (65.9\%–96.5\%)in all the series. Other common causes include caesarean section, advanced cervical cancer, uterine rupture, and Gishiri cut. The identified predisposing factors were early marriage and pregnancy, which were rampant in northern Nigeria, while unskilled birth attendance and late presentation to the health facilities was common nationwide. Among the significant contributory factors to high rate of unskilled birth attendancewere poverty, illiteracy, ignorance, restriction of women’s movement, non-permission from husband, and transportation. All but one Nigerian studies revealed that primiparous women were the most vulnerable group. Pregnancy outcome was dismal in most cases related to delivery with still birth rate of 87\%–91.7\%. Stigmatization, divorce and social exclusion werecommon complications. Overall fistula repair success rate was between 75\% and 92\% in a few centres that offer such services.CONCLUSION: Vesicovaginal fistula is prevalent in Nigeria and obstetric factors are mostly implicated. It is a public health issue of concern.},

	abstract = {Introduction and hypothesis The impoverished West African country of Niger has high rates of obstetric fistula. We report a 6-month postoperative follow-up of 384 patients from the Danja Fistula Center and assess factors associated with operative success or failure. Methods The medical records of 384 women who had completed a 6-month follow-up after fistula surgery were reviewed. Cases were categorized as “easy,” “of intermediate complexity,” or “difficult” based on a preoperative points system. Data were analyzed using simple chi-squared statistics and logistic regression. Results The patients were predominantly of Hausa ethnicity (73\%), married young (average 15.9 years), had teenage first pregnancies (average first delivery 16.9 years), and experienced prolonged labor (average 2.3 days) with poor outcomes (89\% stillbirth rate). The average parity was four. Patients commonly developed their fistula during their first delivery (43.5\%), but over half sustained a fistula during a subsequent delivery (56.5\%). Prior fistula surgery elsewhere (average 1.75 operations) was common. The overall surgical success (“closed and dry”) was 54\%. When the 134 primary operations were analyzed separately, the overall success rate was 80\%. Increasing success was seen with decreasing surgical difficulty: 92\% success for “easy” cases, 68\% for “intermediate” cases, and 57\% success for “difficult” cases. Success decreased with increasing numbers of previous attempts at surgical repair. Conclusions These data provide further evidence that clinical outcomes are better when primary fistula repair is performed by expert surgeons in specialist centers with the support of trained fistula nurses.},

	abstract = {Maternal outcomes in most countries of the developed world are good. However, in many developing/resource-poor countries, maternal outcomes are bleaker: Every year, more than 500,000 women die in childbirth, mostly in resource-poor countries. Those who survive often suffer from severe and long-term morbidities. One of the most devastating injuries is obstetric fistula, occurring most often in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Fistula treatment and care are available in many countries across Africa and Asia, but there is a lack of reliable data around clinical factors associated with the success of fistula repair surgery. Most published research has been retrospective. While these studies have provided useful information about the care and treatment of fistula, they are limited by the design. This study was designed to identify practices in care that could lead to the design of prospective and randomized controlled trials. Self-administered questionnaires were completed by 40 surgeons known to provide fistula treatment services in Africa and Asia at private and government hospitals. The questionnaire was divided into three parts to address the following issues: prophylactic use of antibiotics before, during, and after fistula surgery; urethral catheter management; and management practices for patients with urinary incontinence following fistula repair. The results provide a glimpse into current practices in fistula treatment and care across a wide swath of geographic, economic, and organizational considerations. There is consensus in treatment in some areas (routine use of prophylactic antibiotics, limited bed rest until the catheter is removed, nonsurgical treatment for postsurgical incontinence), while there are wide variations in practice in other areas (duration of catheter use, surgical treatments for postsurgical incontinence). These findings are based on a small sample and do not allow for recommending changes in clinical care, but they point to issues for possible clinical trial research that would contribute to more efficient and effective fistula care. The findings from the survey allowed us to consider clinical practices most influential in the cost, efficacy, and safety of fistula treatment. These considerations led us to formulate recommendations for eight randomized controlled trials on the following subjects: 1) Efficacy/safety of short-term catheterization; 2) efficacy of surgical and nonsurgical therapies for urinary incontinence; 3) technical measures during fistula repair to reduce the incidence of post-surgery incontinence; 4) identification of predictive factors for "incurable fistula"; 5) usefulness of urodynamic studies in the management of urinary incontinence; 6) incidence and significance of multi-drug resistant bacteria in the fistula population; 7) primary management of small, new fistulas by catheter drainage; and 8) antibiotic prophylaxis in fistula repair.},

	abstract = {This paper draws on the narrative of a Samburu woman, whom we call Sasha, from northern Kenya. She has been living with recto- and vesico-vaginal fistula for more than ten years. Her homeland is characterized by abject poverty, patriarchy and traditional practices involving witchcraft, which is intertwined with the teachings of Christian evangelist missionaries that traverse the last two centuries. Sasha’s research interview offered representations of the broader social and political aspects affecting women with vaginal fistula and how this influences their lived experiences. We suggest that this condition is more than a biomedical issue, which we explain through our interpretive feminist analysis of Sasha’s story. An African feminist lens enables attention towards the influences of patriarchy, African ethnicities and underdevelopment of the African continent.},

In the earliest times they were basically dependent on the supernatural forces (religious approach) for the cure of their ailments. But since the advent of scientific medicine, human beings, especially those in the advanced countries, have ignored or drastically reduced their emphasis on the age-long religious approach. However, religion still remains an indispensable component of healthcare though this seems to be unnoticed. This study, therefore, examines the relevance and/or role of religion in modern health care delivery in Nigeria. It uses Christianity as its reference point. Data were collected from Akwa Ibom State in south- eastern Nigeria. Result shows that patients combine prayers with medical care. It recommends that government should consider input from religion when formulating health care policies.},

	abstract = {Background: The uneven global and national distribution of obstetric fistulas suggests a complex network of determinants contributing to fistula development. This study aims to create an understanding of the determinants of obstetric fistula in Uganda and to give a framework for health policy improvement.
Methods: A scoping review of existing literature was performed, searching the PubMed/MEDLINE database, Ugandan Demographic and Health Surveys, and official sources of Ugandan statistics. Data was analysed using the model for the determinants of health by Dahlgren and Whitehead.
Results: Obstetric fistulas are associated with different personal lifestyle factors, certain social and community networks, as well as poor working and living conditions. Malnutrition, early childbearing, limited female empowerment, lack of awareness of childbearing risks, low socioeconomic status, and long distances to emergency obstetric care play a part. Certain regions of Uganda are in particular associated with obstetric fistula, where an accumulation of determinants is notable.
Conclusion: Analysis using the model of Dahlgren and Whitehead shows that obstetric fistulas are associated with determinants at different levels of society. Poverty and low education link these in a web that is disproportionately hard to escape from for the poorest women. This inequity asks for co-operation between ministries to dismantle the environment for obstetric fistula.},
